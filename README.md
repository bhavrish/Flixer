# Project 2 - *Flixer*

**Flixer** is a movies app displaying box office and top rental DVDs using [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can tap a cell to see a detail view (+5pts)
- [x] User can tap a tab bar button to view a grid layout of Movie Posters using a CollectionView (+5pts)

The following **stretch** features are implemented:

- [ ] In the detail view, when the user taps the poster, a new screen is presented modally where they can view the trailer (+3pts)
- [ ] Customize the navigation bar (+1pt)

   - ...
   - ...

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
I could improve my application by adding trailers for all the movies.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. What is the point of the tableview deletage?
2. I could improve my app by adding ratings of the movies to give the user a general idea of how the movie is.
