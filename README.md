# Project 1 - *Flixer*

**Flixer** is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** user stories are complete:

- [x] User sees app icon in home screen and styled launch screen (+1pt)
- [x] User can scroll through a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie DB API (+5pt)
- [x] User can "Pull to refresh" the movie list (+2pt)
- [ ] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies to load (+2pt)

The following **stretch** user stories are implemented:

- [ ] User sees an alert when there's a networking error (+1pt)
- [ ] User can search for a movie (+3pt)
- [ ] While poster is being fetched, user see's a placeholder image (+1pt)
- [ ] User sees image transition for images coming from network, not when it is loaded from cache (+1pt)
- [ ] Customize the selection effect of the cell (+1pt)
- [ ] For the large poster, load the low resolution image first and then switch to the high resolution image when complete (+2pt)

The following **additional** user stories are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality! (+1-3pts)

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. I could try a collection view instead of a table view.
2. If I allow the user to click on a movie to get more information, and then the user has the option to go back to where he/ she left off, what type of data structure is in use here?

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

Only half the image was being displayed, but this was resolved by setting the TableView height equal to the MovieCell height.
